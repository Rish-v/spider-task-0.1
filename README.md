# spider-task-0.1
Hey there! My name is Rishabh Verma. I am studying B.Tech in Instrumentation and controls engineering in NIT, Trichy. I know C and C++ and some basics of HTML. I am still stuck with the first task as I can't understand what this Git thing is. I am not even sure if this is what the readme.md file means or is this what is given in task 0.1. I guess that's all about me as I don't know what else to say. Thank you!!
